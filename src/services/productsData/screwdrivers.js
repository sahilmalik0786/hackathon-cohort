        description: "Three years. Countless revisions. All in the pursuit of letting you see inside the ultimate ratcheting screwdriver, without sacrificing any performance. This is your front-row seat to everything we obsessed over: the smooth and satisfying ratchet mechanism, the tight tolerances, and the convenient bit storage that’s made it a favorite in thousands of toolkits.Ultra-satisfying ratchet feel & soundOptimized for smoothness and the most satisfying feel and sound, tightening every screw is a moment in itself. We don’t blame you if you find excuses to use it! Optimized back-forceWe’ve also fine-tuned our ratchet to have an extremely light back-force. This allows for improved control, reduced fatigue, and the ability to ratchet-drive even the smallest screws.Convenient internal bit storage Designed in partnership with Megapro, the handle features on-the-go storage for up to twelve 20mm bits or six longer bits up to 42mm. It satisfyingly opens and securely closes using a spring-loaded mechanism. Included with the screwdriver are 12 rust resistant bits - PH0, PH1, PH2, H2, H2.5, H4, SL2, SL4, SL6, SQ1, SQ2, and a super strong 5x5 magnet bit we call “the screw retriever”.Secure magnetic bit retention Never lose a bit again. Built in the shaft is a 5.4 newton pull-force broach magnet which ensures your bits stay in place during your entire project. Fine-tuned ergonomics for comfort and ease-of-use Our three-lobed handle design naturally follows the shape of your hand for maximum comfort during long sessions. An intricate diamond-cut knurling on the shaft also allows you to have precision control over the ratchet, no matter how you hold it.",

With an laser-engraved logo and discreet detailing, no attention to detail was spared in creating this precision performance pen.

Smooth bolt action provides a satisfying feel and easy activation
Our spring-loaded bolt action allows this elegant pen to double as the perfect fidget toy that you can sneak into even the stuffiest meetings.

Built with repurposed LTT screwdriver shafts from our original launch run, you can expect the same premium quality as our tools
In the spirit of sustainability, we machined down screwdriver shafts we couldn’t use and turned them into a writing tool with a high quality feel and finish.

Comfortable and grippy knurling
Our knurled finish at the pen’s grip point provides a perpetually comfortable writing experience while outlasting any standard gel or foam-based pen grip. This is a softer knurling than the LTT screwdriver to allow for extended use and comfort.

Compatible with Parker G2 refills
Shipped with a Schmidt EasyFlow 9000 medium (black) pen cartridge inside, we made the Scribedriver easy to refill with a standard format for long-term everyday use. `,
