With an laser-engraved logo and discreet detailing, no attention to detail was spared in creating this precision performance pen.

Smooth bolt action provides a satisfying feel and easy activation
Our spring-loaded bolt action allows this elegant pen to double as the perfect fidget toy that you can sneak into even the stuffiest meetings.

Built with repurposed LTT screwdriver shafts from our original launch run, you can expect the same premium quality as our tools
In the spirit of sustainability, we machined down screwdriver shafts we couldn’t use and turned them into a writing tool with a high quality feel and finish.

Comfortable and grippy knurling
Our knurled finish at the pen’s grip point provides a perpetually comfortable writing experience while outlasting any standard gel or foam-based pen grip. This is a softer knurling than the LTT screwdriver to allow for extended use and comfort.

Compatible with Parker G2 refills
Shipped with a Schmidt EasyFlow 9000 medium (black) pen cartridge inside, we made the Scribedriver easy to refill with a standard format for long-term everyday use. `,
