        description:"Three years. Countless revisions. All in the pursuit of letting you see inside the ultimate ratcheting screwdriver, without sacrificing any performance. This is your front-row seat to everything we obsessed over: the smooth and satisfying ratchet mechanism, the tight tolerances, and the convenient bit storage that’s made it a favorite in thousands of toolkits.Ultra-satisfying ratchet feel & soundOptimized for smoothness and the most satisfying feel and sound, tightening every screw is a moment in itself. We don’t blame you if you find excuses to use it! Optimized back-forceWe’ve also fine-tuned our ratchet to have an extremely light back-force. This allows for improved control, reduced fatigue, and the ability to ratchet-drive even the smallest screws.Convenient internal bit storage Designed in partnership with Megapro, the handle features on-the-go storage for up to twelve 20mm bits or six longer bits up to 42mm. It satisfyingly opens and securely closes using a spring-loaded mechanism. Included with the screwdriver are 12 rust resistant bits - PH0, PH1, PH2, H2, H2.5, H4, SL2, SL4, SL6, SQ1, SQ2, and a super strong 5x5 magnet bit we call “the screw retriever”.Secure magnetic bit retention Never lose a bit again. Built in the shaft is a 5.4 newton pull-force broach magnet which ensures your bits stay in place during your entire project. Fine-tuned ergonomics for comfort and ease-of-use Our three-lobed handle design naturally follows the shape of your hand for maximum comfort during long sessions. An intricate diamond-cut knurling on the shaft also allows you to have precision control over the ratchet, no matter how you hold it.",
